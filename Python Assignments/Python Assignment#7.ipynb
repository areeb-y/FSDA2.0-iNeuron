    "Q2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Raw strings are often used in regular expressions because backslashes have a special meaning in regular expressions, and using raw strings allows us to avoid escaping them. In Python, backslashes are used as escape characters in string literals. However, in regular expressions, backslashes are used to escape special characters, such as the period (.), asterisk (*), and plus sign (+), among others. Using raw strings in regular expressions tells Python to ignore the backslash characters and treat them as literal backslashes, which is often what we want in regular expressions. "

    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "The 'search()' method in Python's regular expression module 're' returns a match object if a pattern is found in a string. If the pattern is not found, the method returns 'None'. The match object contains information about the matching string, including the starting and ending index positions of the match and the matching text."

    "\n",
    "Calling 'group()' with no arguments returns the entire match, while calling it with an integer argument n returns the nth group of the match (if it exists). For example, given a 'Match' object named 'match_obj', 'match_obj.group(0)' returns the entire match and 'match_obj.group(1)' returns the first group of the match."

This means that whitespace and comments can be added to the regular expression to make it more readable without affecting the pattern being matched. In verbose mode, whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines) are ignored, except when they are inside a character class or when they are escaped with a backslash. Comments are also allowed in the pattern by prefixing them with the # character. The verbose mode can be helpful for creating complex regular expressions that are easier to read and maintain."
