    "Q1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reusability: Functions allow you to write a piece of code once and then use it multiple times throughout your program, which saves time and makes the code easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modularity: Functions break down large programs into smaller, more manageable chunks. This makes it easier to organize the code and debug errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away the details of how a piece of code works. Instead of needing to understand how the code works, you can just call the function and trust that it will do what it's supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Encapsulation: Functions can encapsulate complex logic or functionality, which makes it easier to reuse that code in other programs or share it with other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, functions help make programs more efficient, easier to read and understand, and easier to maintain and modify."

    "\n",
    "Ans: There is one global scopes, which is created when the program starts running.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: When a function call returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in the local scope are forgotten. Any value assigned to a local variable inside the function is lost after the function returns. If we try to access a local variable after the function call has returned, we will get a NameError because the variable no longer exists. The values of the global variables do not change, even if they are accessed or modified inside a function."

    "Ans: To make a function variable refer to the global variable with the same name, you need to use the global keyword inside the function. This tells Python that you want to use the global variable instead of creating a new local variable with the same name. "

    "\n",
    "Ans: To save a program from crashing if it encounters an error, you can use exception handling. This involves wrapping the code that might raise an exception in a try block and then handling any exceptions that are raised in the corresponding except block. By using exception handling, you can gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing."

    "Ans: The 'try' and 'except' clauses are used for error handling. The purpose of the 'try' clause is to identify a block of code in which an error can occur. If an error occurs in the 'try' block, Python will look for the corresponding 'except'' block to handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the 'except' clause is to provide a block of code that will be executed if an error occurs in the 'try' block. The 'except' block must specify the type of error that it will handle. When an error occurs in the 'try' block, Python will check the 'except' blocks to see if any of them can handle the error. If an 'excpet' block can handle the error, its code will be executed. If no 'except' block can handle the error, the program will terminate and an error message will be displayed."
